## Eeek! Ajax Event Calendar Stopped Working / Doesn't Work ##
This is typically caused by a conflict with another plugin/theme.  Before submitting a bug to the issue tracker, follow these troubleshooting tips to isolate and identify the problem accurately:
  * Switch to the default WordPress Theme ([Twenty Twelve](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve) as of this update). If the calendar works, the conflict is caused by your theme - ask the theme author to investigate.

  * Still doesn't work...?  Disable all plugins except the Ajax Event Calendar. With all possible external conflicts now disabled, the calendar should work.

  * Still no luck...?  Check your /wp-content folder for a file called "debug.log" - it may contain errors regarding the cause of the conflict.  If there are no errors that directly mention Ajax Event Calendar, check for JavaScript errors via your browser's JavaScript console.

  * JavaScript errors may appear in the console, listing both the filename and the line number of each error.  Reload the calendar page in the browser and note any errors you find.  If any errors mention Ajax Event Calendar, be sure to include them in your bug report.

  * If you use Firefox browser, and I highly recommend using the [Firebug plugin](http://getfirebug.com/) to debug JavaScript conflicts.

  * If the calendar works as expected, begin restoring your original plugins one by one, check the calendar after each.

  * When the calendar stops functioning, you'll have a culprit.  Note the error in the console, it will be helpful when reporting the error to the  plugin/theme developers.

  * If no errors appear in either the Firebug Console or the PHP logs, search the [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1) for known bugs and resolutions.

  * If you can't find your issue, submit a bug report on the  [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1), be sure to include ALL STEPS necessary to reproduce the issue - if I am unable to reproduce the problem I will not be able to assist.

  * Did you add the `[calendar]` shortcode to a page, post or text widget?

## Your server has PHP magic\_quotes\_gpc set to active. This produces formatting errors in the Ajax Event Calendar plugin. Learn how to disable this setting in this forum thread. Ask your host provider for help. ##
  * If the recommendations in the forum don't work out, try adding the following line in your .htaccess file: php\_value magic\_quotes\_gpc off

## I have a feature request for the plugin, what steps should I take? ##
Search the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1) for enhancement requests.
  * If you find your request already in queue, **click on the star** beside the issue number to indicate your interest in the feature.
  * If you don't find your request in queue, submit a feature request include the purpose of the feature and detailed scenarios of how it would be used.

## I want to change the appearance of the calendar/eventlist ##
  * View your site using Firefox browser with [Firebug plugin](http://getfirebug.com/) activated.  Read about using Firebug and learn how to "inspect" page elements for styling.
  * Firebug allows you to adjust the style on a live site, so once you have the desired look, just add the style to **your theme's css** not the custom.css file (the custom.css file will not be preserved when the plugin is updated).
  * REMEMBER: edits to existing style definitions require use of the **!important** flag after the property value, for example: `#aec-calendar{background:#blue !important;...}`.<br><b>BE CAREFUL</b> this can have unanticipated effects on your design when applied to elements used throughout your theme.  For that reason, it is good practice to use the most specific selectors possible when performing these overrides.<br>

<h2>The front-end calendar does not work in my custom theme</h2>
<ul><li>Make sure your theme templates contain <code>&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;</code> just before the closing <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag and <code>&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;</code> just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</li></ul>

</li><li>Next, based on your needs assign any/all of the capabilities listed below, to existing or new custom roles.<br>
<ul><li>Users assigned the <b>aec_add_events</b> capability can edit and delete events they create by clicking on events in the administrative calendar page.<br>
</li><li>Users assigned the <b>aec_manage_events</b> capability can edit and delete all events.<br>

<h2>Is there a way to configure the WordPress to allow users that come to the site to can register and create their own events (so not every event would need to be created by the administrator)?</h2>

<h2>Does the AEC support the WordPress Network (Multisite) feature? When I tried to implement it on a multisite I was unable to add events or categories on any of the sub sites except the primary.</h2>

<h2>How can I add "print calendar" functionality on the calendar page?</h2>
<ul><li>To add print functionality, open a post or page, select the HTML tab in !Wordpress Post editor, and enter this code snippet above or below the calendar shortcode: <code>&lt;a href="javascript:window.print();"&gt;Print Page&lt;/a&gt;</code>.<br>
</li><li>If you want to hide certain page elements, such as sidebars you'll need to add print specific rules to your theme stylesheet.<br>

</li><li>However, you can input links in the Event Link field to any URL of your choosing.</li></ul>

<h2>Can I import/link Google calendars to the Ajax Event Calendar?</h2>
<ul><li>No, this calendar emulates the look and feel of Google Calendar but also extends the field options beyond what is offered by Google.</li></ul>

<ul><li><a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language'>Configure WordPress in Your Language</a></li></ul>

<h2>The calendar does not work when SSL logins for WordPress Administrators are forced with âdefine('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);â in the wp-config.php file.</h2>
This issue can be resolved by overriding the URL in the plugin code to the http:// version instead of the https:// version that is returned by the "admin_url()" function.
